This is a basic addon to remove the default Blizzard sell price string from the item tooltips.

It should be used with the other mods that show selling info, avoiding the doubling up on the vendor information.

This addon was inspired by the [RichyJ](https://www.curseforge.com/members/richyj/projects)'s addon [Remove Sell Price](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/remove-sell-price) (hence the name), which was broken with the 10.0.2 (Dragonflight) patch release due to the [tooltip API changes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_10.0.2/API_changes).
It doesn't contain any code from the original work, hence the new license and author (me).
